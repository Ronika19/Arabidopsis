AT1G08880	2367.4666704029	1409.0553241689	0.595174302466148	Encodes HTA5, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A.  Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

AT1G11310	4504.6318911633	1770.3187312575	0.392999644372789	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter. It is a novel virulence target of the P. syringae type III secreted effector HopZ2.

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT1G50240	328.0214736213	101.4498795902	0.309278165451216	The FUSED (FU) gene belongs to Ser/Thr protein kinase family and has a key role in the hedgehog signaling pathway known to control cell proliferation and patterning in fruit flies and humans . Arabidopsis thaliana genome has a single Fu gene that is involved in male meiosis cytokinesis. Cytokinesis-defective mutants, named two-in-one (tio), result from mutations in Arabidopsis Fu. Phenotypic analysis of tio mutants reveals an essential role for TIO in conventional modes of cytokinesis in plant meristems and during male gametogenesis. TIO is tightly localized to the midline of the nascent phragmoplast and remains associated with the expanding phragmoplast ring. This gene was previously annotated as two gene models, AT1G50230.1 and AT1G50240.1, however the experimental evidence exists (Oh et al, Current Biology, 2005) showing that these two models are in fact single gene, named FUSED.

Based on protein sequence alignment analysis, it has a typical RD signaling domain in its catalytic loop and possesses autophosphorylation activity.It is required for the suppression of defense responses in absence of pathogen infection or upon abscisic acid treatment. Loss-of-function mutants display enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum. Its expression is repressed by pathogen infection and biological elicitors and is induced abscisic acid.Expression is strongly repressed by elicitors and fungal infection, and is induced by the hormone abscisic acid (ABA). Insertional mutants show increased expression of PHYTOALEXIN-DEFICIENT 3 (PAD3), enhanced resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pectobacterium carotovorum infection and reduced physiological responses to ABA, suggesting that LYK3 is important for the cross-talk between signaling pathways activated by ABA and pathogens (PMID:24639336).

Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated  H2AX (&#947;-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2.  Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of  wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed  the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse &#947;-H2AX  foci throughout the chromatin. However,  their accumulation is not contemporaneous with  that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no &#947;-H2AX  foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when  AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an  equally swift accumulation of &#947;-H2AX to a maximum  of >50 diffuse foci. The level of &#947;H2AX then remains  constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a  gradual decrease to 10?20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S  period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

AT1G68910	602.7162262674	219.6608006931	0.364451446833365	Encodes one of the WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIT1/AT5G11390, WIT2/AT1G68910) required for RanGAP nuclear envelope association in root tip cells.  Ran GTPase plays essential roles in multiple cellular processes, including nucleocytoplasmic transport, spindle formation, and postmitotic nuclear envelope reassembly. The cytoplasmic Ran GTPase activating protein RanGAP is critical to establish a functional RanGTP/RanGDP gradient across the nuclear envelope and is associated with the outer surface of the nuclear envelope in metazoan and higher plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana RanGAP association with the root tip nuclear envelope requires a family of likely plant-specific nucleoporins combining coiled-coil and transmembrane domains (CC-TMD) and WPP domain-interacting proteins (WIPs).  WIT1 and WIT2 have been identified as a second family of CC-TMD proteins, structurally similar, yet clearly distinct from the WIP family, that is required for RanGAP nuclear envelop association in root tip cells.

AT5G03150	223.5356113469	119.6736318387	0.53536718877862	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

But, the submitted sequence of 110 nucleotides is only part of the 160 nucleotide sequence predicted by Northern blotting. It is assumed that a 5' portion of the gene is missing and its 5' end has not been conclusively mapped. Sequence analysis of this snoRNA suggests that it may not function like other C/D box family members that modify rRNAs or snRNAs. Its true biological target remains unknown. The promoter of this snoRNA has hallmarks of the snRNA promoters targeted by RNA polymerase II,  indicating that it might also have a TMG (2,2,7 trimethyguanosine) cap. SnoRNA108 may also play a novel role in ribosome biogenesis (Marker 2002).

Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation results in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity. Its expression is downregulated at hypoxic conditions. RAP2.12 overexpression inhibits this downregulation.

AT5G65700	2694.8924416558	1701.5162882045	0.631385602595349	Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT3G11820	1051.4911953579	407.5789614816	0.387619947062772	Encodes a syntaxin localized at the plasma membrane (SYR1, Syntaxin Related Protein 1, also known as SYP121, PENETRATION1/PEN1).  SYR1/PEN1 is a member of the SNARE superfamily proteins.  SNARE proteins are involved in cell signaling, vesicle traffic, growth and development.  SYR1/PEN1 functions in positioning anchoring of the KAT1 K+ channel protein at the plasma membrane. Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis sp. hordei.  SYR1/PEN1 is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus. Required for mlo resistance. The syp121 point mutation results in stomatal phenotypes that reduce CO2 assimilation, slow vegetative growth and increase water use efficiency in the whole plant, conditional upon high light intensities and low relative humidity.

Based on sequence homology in their motor domains, POK1 and POK2 belong to the kinesin-12 class which also includes the well-characterized group of phragmoplast-associated kinesins AtPAKRPs. Both kinesins are composed of an N-terminal motor domain throughout the entire C terminus and putative cargo binding tail domains. The expression domains for POK2 constructs were broader than those for POK1; both are expressed in tissues enriched for dividing cells. The phenotype of pok1/pok2 double mutants strongly resembles that of maize tan1 mutants, characterized by misoriented mitotic cytoskeletal arrays and misplaced cell walls.

Very similar to BAM1,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM2 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT3G55360	2182.7284354908	1417.1895285211	0.649274323584114	Enoyl-CoA reductase is involved in all very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) elongation reactions that are required for cuticular wax, storage lipid and sphingolipid metabolism. The protein is located in the ER, but in contrast to its yeast homolog TSC13 is not particularly enriched in the nuclear envelope-vacuole junction. Mutants in this gene show abnormal organ morphology and stem glossiness. Cells in all tissues are only about 1/3 of the size of wild type cells. The morphological changes are most likely to result from the reduction in the VLCFA content of sphingolipids. Mutants also show abnormalities in the endocytic membrane organization and transport as well as reduced trichome papillae.

FKBP20-2 has a unique pair of cysteines at the C terminus and was found to be reduced by thioredoxin (Trx) (itself reduced by NADPH by means of NADP-Trx reductase). The FKBP20-2 protein, which contains only two of the five amino acids required for catalysis, showed a low level of PPIase activity that was unaffected on reduction by Trx.  Genetic disruption of the FKBP20-2 gene provide evidence that FKBP20-2 participates specifically in the accumulation of the PSII supercomplex in the chloroplast thylakoid lumen by means of a mechanism that has yet to be determined.

AT2G17290	524.1059300587	316.4560889926	0.603801771441809	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT2G33860	1279.1530510164	527.8340152333	0.412643361804038	ettin (ett) mutations have pleiotropic effects on Arabidopsis flower development, causing increases in perianth organ number, decreases in stamen number and anther formation, and apical-basal patterning defects in the gynoecium. The ETTIN gene encodes a protein with homology to DNA binding proteins which bind to auxin response elements. ETT transcript is expressed throughout stage 1 floral meristems and subsequently resolves to a complex pattern within petal, stamen and carpel primordia.  ETT probably functions to impart regional identity in floral meristems that affects perianth organ number spacing, stamen formation, and regional differentiation in stamens and the gynoecium. During stage 5, ETT expression appears in a ring at the top  of the floral meristem before morphological appearance of the gynoecium, consistent with the proposal that ETT is involved in prepatterning apical and basal boundaries in the gynoecium primordium.  It is a target of the ta-siRNA tasiR-ARF. ETT is also a target of AP2; integrateing the functions of AGAMOUS and APETALA2 in floral meristem determinacy.

AT2G47460	8.4548436328	2.2886407855	0.270689900948773	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.

AT4G20260	11923.3960288403	2193.9009751981	0.183999673406091	Encodes a Ca2+ and Cu2+ binding protein. N-terminal myristylation on glycine 2 appears to enable it to associate tightly with the plasma membrane. Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2. Mannitol, sorbitol, and the flg22 oligopeptide also increase expression levels. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Its promoter is highly modular with each region contributing to specific aspects of the gene's spatial and temporal expression.  Double mutant analysis with PDF2, another L1-specific gene, suggests that their functions are partially redundant and the absence of both of the genes result in abnormal shoot development.
