Eight types of APX have been described for Arabidopsis: three cytosolic (APX1, APX2, APX6), two chloroplastic types (stromal sAPX, thylakoid tAPX), and three microsomal (APX3, APX4, APX5) isoforms. At least part of the induction of heat shock proteins during light stress in Arabidopsis is mediated by H2O2 that is scavenged by APX1. Expression of the gene is downregulated in the presence of paraquat, an inducer of photoxidative stress. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

However, unlike DCP2, DCP1 itself does not have mRNA decapping activity in vitro.  DCP1, DCP2 and VCS colocalize in cytoplasmic loci, which are putative Arabidopsis mRNA processing bodies.  Null mutants of DCP1, DCP2, and VCS accumulate capped mRNAs with a reduced degradation rate. These mutants also share a similar lethal phenotype at the seedling cotyledon stage, with disorganized veins, swollen root hairs, and altered epidermal cell morphology. The protein was shown by immunoprecipitation not to interact with DCP2.

AT1G08600	709.6430593688	1798.5757519205	2.53447945157142	The Arabidopsis ATRX harbours a N-terminal ADD domain and a C-terminal helicase domain and is devoid of the large central region involved in DAXX interaction in mammals. Arabidopsis ATRX mutant alleles are viable, but with reduced fertility. Their combination with mutants for the H3.3 chaperone HIRA impairs plant survival. ATRX loss affects cellular histone H3.3 pools and modulates the H3.1/H3.3 balance. Notably, at a genome-wide scale, loss of ATRX leads to a reduced H3.3 level at genes characterized by elevated H3.3 occupancy and high expression, including the 45S ribosomal DNA (45S rDNA) loci. Indeed, expression of specific 45S rDNA sequence variants is altered by ATRX loss (DOI:10.1105/tpc.16.00877)

Essential for gametophyte development.  In Arabidopsis, the RPT5 subunit is encoded by two highly homologous genes, RPT5a and RPT5b.  RPT5a and RPT5b show accession-dependent functional redundancy.  In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality, indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession, a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants in Col background showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype.

AT1G11000	184.5533461493	352.5248421332	1.91015145207941	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO4 belongs to the clade I, with AtMLO11 and AtMLO14. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots and lateral root primordia, in flower and fruit abscission zone, in vascular system of root, cotyledons and young leaves, it was not expressed in mature rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

AT1G11400	364.7563754916	886.5794416227	2.43060711530488	The PYM gene encodes a protein capable of interacting with MAGO, and Y14, whose orthologs form part of the exon junction complex in animal cells. In vitro binding assays indicate that PYM can bind to MAGO and Y14 either individually, or when they are together. But, MAGO-Y14-PYM ternary complexes are difficult to detect in vivo in Arabidopsis based on pull-down experiments. However there is some evidence for a weak association in Arabidopsis flowers. PYM appears primarily cytoplasmic, but it also seems to into the nucleus at times. Its nuclear localization signal has not been rigorously defined, but there is evidence for a nuclear export signal between amino acids 171-205 in the C-terminus.

The atU2AF35a protein and its homolog, atU2AF35b, contain most of the conserved domains of hsU2AF35, including the psiRRM, one RS domain, two zinc fingers, and the two regions for interacting with U2AF large subunit. Both proteins lack the stretch of glycines present in human U2AF35. The sequences are overall 83% identical, and each Arabidopsis homolog shows approximately 70% similarity to hsU2AF35.    U2AF(35) homologs were also identified from maize, rice and other plants with large-scale EST projects. Both genes are expressed in all major tissues, with atU2AF(35)a expressed at a higher level than atU2AF(35)b in most tissues. The expression patterns were different in roots: atU2AF(35)b expressed strongly in whole young roots and root tips and atU2AF(35)a limited to root vascular regions.

In vitro, an N-terminal Myb domain enables it to interact with double-stranded telomeric repeats.Mutations in TRB1 and TRB3 enhance the lhp1 mutant phenotype. Triple mutants are more strongly affected than the respective double mutants with lhp1. TRB1 binds non-H3K27me3 target genes predominantly at the transcription start sites and its presence increases the expression of several of these targets, enriched for functions of primary metabolism. At H3K27me3 target genes, TRB1 binding is more distributed across gene bodies and at extended promoter regions, corresponding to an enrichment of putative binding sites "RMCCTAR". At these genes, TRB1 particiaptes in the repression because several direct targets are further upregulated in trb1 lhp1 double mutants as compared to lhp1 mutants.

UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.

AT1G73590	231.813648346	371.0424983999	1.60060678500728	Encodes an auxin efflux carrier involved in shoot and root development. It is involved in the maintenance of embryonic auxin gradients.  Loss of function severely affects organ initiation, pin1 mutants are characterised by an inflorescence meristem that does not initiate any flowers, resulting in the formation of a naked inflorescence stem.  PIN1 is involved in the determination of leaf shape by actively promoting development of leaf margin serrations.  In roots, the protein mainly resides at the basal end of the vascular cells, but weak signals can be detected in the epidermis and the cortex.  Expression levels and polarity of this auxin efflux carrier change during primordium development suggesting that cycles of auxin build-up and depletion accompany, and may direct, different stages of primordium development. PIN1 action on plant development does not strictly require function of PGP1 and PGP19 proteins.

AT5G11310	116.3829348045	364.8837181302	3.13519949246109	The SOAR1 gene encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein which localizes to both the cytosol and nucleus. Down-regulation of SOAR1 strongly enhances, but up-regulation of SOAR1 almost completely impairs, ABA responses, revealing that SOAR1 is a critical, negative, regulator of ABA signalling. Further genetic evidence supports that SOAR1 functions downstream of ABAR and probably upstream of an ABA-responsive transcription factor ABI5. Changes in the SOAR1 expression alter expression of a subset of ABA-responsive genes including ABI5. These findings provide important information to elucidate further the functional mechanism of PPR proteins and the complicated ABA signalling network.

Transcript levels for several ER-localized chaperones (e.g. BIP1/2) and other ATP-requiring ER proteins (e.g. CPK2) are reduced in er-ant1 knock-out lines, suggesting a lack of adequate ATP transport into the ER in these mutants. They also have reduced seed oil and seed protein levels.

AT5G45307	0.5661539389	15.0665808415	26.6121628876651	Encodes a microRNA that targets AGO1.  MicroRNAs are regulatory RNAs with a mature length of ~21-nucleotides that are processed from hairpin precursors by Dicer-like enzymes. MicroRNAs can negatively regulate gene expression by attenuating translation or by directing mRNA cleavage.Mature sequence: UCGCUUGGUGCAGGUCGGGAA.  MIR168a is highly expressed and predominantly produces a 21-nt miR168 species. By contrast, MIR168b is expressed at low levels and produces an equal amount of 21- and 22-nt miR168 species. Only the 21-nt miR168 is preferentially stabilized by AGO1, and consequently, the accumulation of the 22-nt but not the 21-nt miR168 is reduced when DCL1 activity is impaired. mir168a mutants with strongly reduced levels of 21-nt miR168 are viable but exhibit developmental defects, particularly during environmentally challenging conditions.

AT5G56290	1346.9949083342	2964.07853033	2.20051205241422	Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

AT5G58230	892.9879882277	1198.2825667881	1.34187982658794	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

Knockouts of CAP1 produced more cytoplasmic NH4+ and ceased growth of root hairs on MS medium except when NH4+ was depleted; NH4+ depletion reestablished the Ca2+ gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.

Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

In flies, TCTP functions guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the TOR signaling pathway. TCTP is expressed throughout the plant with highest levels seen in meristematic regions of the shoot and root. Loss of function alleles are not transmitted through the male gametophyte due to defects in pollen tube growth. Hypomorphs, generated through RNAi, are dwarf and have smaller cells. These plants also have defects in lateral and primary root growth as well as root hair growth. The phenotypes are similar to TOR mutants suggesting that TCTP functions in the is pathway in Arabidopsis as well.

AT3G44310	18926.7894624227	33524.9648766134	1.77129697264155	Mutants are resistant to indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN). NIT1 catalyzes the terminal activation step in indole-acetic acid biosynthesis. Predominantly expressed isoform of nitrilase isoenzyme family.   Aggregation of NIT1 in cells directly abutting wound sites is one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide-induced cell death.  The protein undergoes thiolation following treatment with the  oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide. It is also involved in the conversion of IAN to IAM (indole-3-acetamide) and other non-auxin-related metabolic processes. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
AT3G44320	60.7651687455	135.9904469917	2.23796707553406	This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (EC 3.5.5.1) and IAN to indole-3-acetamide (IAM) at lower levels.  It is the only one of the four Arabidopsis nitrilases whose mRNA levels are strongly induced when plants experience sulphur deprivation. This enzyme likely participates in other non-auxin-related metabolic pathways.

AT3G47450	1775.2714763791	2773.5962865133	1.56235050436929	Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. Mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling and attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence, cell death, nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.  Its localization to the chloroplast is enhanced by S-acylation.

AT3G60190	2554.7538008029	4831.6079212897	1.89122252006093	At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central `dynamin 2` domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

MicroRNAs are regulatory RNAs with a mature length of ~21-nucleotides that are processed from hairpin precursors by Dicer-like enzymes. MicroRNAs can negatively regulate gene expression by attenuating translation or by directing mRNA cleavage.Mature sequence: UUCCACAGCUUUCUUGAACUG. miR396 expression increased with leaf development, antagonizing with expression of GRFs. Transcript accumulates in the distal zone of young developing seeds, restricing the expression of GRF2 to the proximal part. miR396 attenuates cell  proliferation in developing leaves through the repression of GRF activity and a decrease in the expression of cell cycle genes.

PGP1 mediates cellular efflux of IAA and interacts with PIN genes that may confer an accelerated vectoral component to PGP-mediated transport. The non-polar localization of PGP1 at root and shoot apices, where IAA gradient-driven transport is impaired, may be required to confer directionality to auxin transport in those tissues. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

In wild-type Arabidopsis, vernalization results in the stable reduction of the levels of the floral repressor FLC. In vrn2 mutants, FLC expression is downregulated normally in response to vernalization, but instead of remaining low, FLC mRNA levels increase when plants are returned to normal temperatures. VRN2 maintains FLC repression after a cold treatment, serving as a mechanism for the cellular memory of vernalization. Required for complete repression of FLC. Required for the methylation of histone H3

MicroRNAs are regulatory RNAs with a mature length of ~21-nucleotides that are processed from hairpin precursors by Dicer-like enzymes. MicroRNAs can negatively regulate gene expression by attenuating translation or by directing mRNA cleavage. Mature sequence: UCGCUUGGUGCAGGUCGGGAA.  MIR168a is highly expressed and predominantly produces a 21-nt miR168 species. By contrast, MIR168b is expressed at low levels and produces an equal amount of 21- and 22-nt miR168 species. Only the 21-nt miR168 is preferentially stabilized by AGO1, and consequently, the accumulation of the 22-nt but not the 21-nt miR168 is reduced when DCL1 activity is impaired. mir168a mutants with strongly reduced levels of 21-nt miR168 are viable but exhibit developmental defects, particularly during environmentally challenging conditions.

AT4G29340	0	17.9164206261		Profilin is a low-molecular weight, actin monomer-binding protein that regulates the organization of actin cytoskeleton in eukaryotes, including higher plants. PRF4 and PRF5 are late pollen-specific and are not detectable in other cell types of the plant body including microspores and root hairs. Immunocytochemical studies at the subcellular level reveal that both the constitutive and pollen-specific profilins are abundant in the cytoplasm. In vegetative cell types, such as root apical cells, profilins showed localization to nuclei in addition to the cytoplasmic staining.

SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.
