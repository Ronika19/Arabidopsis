UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

ALB4 is almost identical to the Alb3/Oxa1/YidC domain of the previously described 110 kDa inner envelope protein ARTEMIS. However, ALB4 is expressed as a separate 55 kDa protein and is located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. Analysis of a T-DNA insertion line with a reduced level of Alb4 revealed chloroplasts with an altered ultrastructure. Mutant plastids are larger, more spherical in appearance and the grana stacks within the mutant lines are less appressed than in the wild-type chloroplasts. ALB4 is required for proper chloroplast biogenesis. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT1G49950	876.4285460743	2395.2977784547	2.7330211791751	Encodes a telomeric DNA binding protein. In vitro, an N-terminal Myb domain enables it to interact with double-stranded telomeric repeats.Mutations in TRB1 and TRB3 enhance the lhp1 mutant phenotype. Triple mutants are more strongly affected than the respective double mutants with lhp1. TRB1 binds non-H3K27me3 target genes predominantly at the transcription start sites and its presence increases the expression of several of these targets, enriched for functions of primary metabolism. At H3K27me3 target genes, TRB1 binding is more distributed across gene bodies and at extended promoter regions, corresponding to an enrichment of putative binding sites "RMCCTAR". At these genes, TRB1 particiaptes in the repression because several direct targets are further upregulated in trb1 lhp1 double mutants as compared to lhp1 mutants.

AT1G70660	51.6530451788	155.1321500325	3.00334955074771	MMZ2/UEV1B encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ2/UEV1B and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ2/UEV1B transcripts are found in most plant organs, but not in the pollen or in seedlings 6 hours or 2 days post-germination. The transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
AT1G70700	1070.9114778067	3490.9934107102	3.25983377996844	JAZ9 is a protein presumed to be involved in jasmonate signaling. JAZ9 transcript levels rise in response to a jasmonate stimulus. JAZ9 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ9-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT5G11260	133.6729003817	1609.6318073589	12.0415716481249	Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. Nuclear localization. Involved in light-regulated transcriptional activation of G-box-containing promoters. Negatively regulated by Cop1. Although cytokinins do not appear to affect the gene's promoter activity, they appear to stabilize the protein. HY5 plays a role in anthocyanin accumulation in far-red light and blue light, but not in red light or in the dark. Mutant studies showed that the gene product is involved in the positive regulation of the PHYA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Binds to G- and Z-boxes, and other ACEs, but not to E-box. Loss of function mutation shows ABA resistant seedling phenotypes suggesting involvement for HY5 in mediating ABA responses. Binds to the promoter of ABI5 and regulates its expression.

AT5G11310	116.3829348045	247.6648411864	2.12801680592114	The SOAR1 gene encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein which localizes to both the cytosol and nucleus. Down-regulation of SOAR1 strongly enhances, but up-regulation of SOAR1 almost completely impairs, ABA responses, revealing that SOAR1 is a critical, negative, regulator of ABA signalling. Further genetic evidence supports that SOAR1 functions downstream of ABAR and probably upstream of an ABA-responsive transcription factor ABI5. Changes in the SOAR1 expression alter expression of a subset of ABA-responsive genes including ABI5. These findings provide important information to elucidate further the functional mechanism of PPR proteins and the complicated ABA signalling network.

CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in  plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat,  cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid  (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not  detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites  of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and  various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl(2), molybdic acid, ZnSO(4), and MgCl(2).  Also regulates nitric oxide levels.

MicroRNAs are regulatory RNAs with a mature length of ~21-nucleotides that are processed from hairpin precursors by Dicer-like enzymes.

All three SSPs encodes active CTD phosphatases like animal SCP1 family proteins, with distinct substrate specificities: SSP4 and SSP4b could dephosphorylate both Ser2-PO(4) and Ser5-PO(4) of CTD, whereas SSP5 dephosphorylated only Ser5-PO(4). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT5G56290	1346.9949083342	3252.944336112	2.41496409228068	Encodes the peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 receptor that facilitates peroxisomal protein translocation. It recognizes proteins with the PTS1 consensus sequence (tripeptide SKL or a conserved variant) at the extreme C terminus.  The protein has several domains, including C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat motifs which act in binding the C-terminal "SKL" targeting signal.  The mechanism of transport has been worked out in other organisms:  The receptor recognizes and binds cytosolic PTS1-containing proteins.  The PEX5-PTS1 complex binds a PEX14/PEX13 receptor complex at the peroxisome membrane and is translocated into the peroxisome matrix in a process dependent on PEX2,PEX10, and PEX12.  In the peroxisome matrix, PEX5 releases its cargo and is recycled to the cytosol in a process dependent on PEX1, PEX4, PEX6 and PEX22.  It is also involved, in conjunction with PEX7, in PTS1- and PTS2-dependent peroxisomal protein import.  RNAi experiments suggest that PEX5 is necessary for the maintenance of both glyoxysomal and leaf peroxisomal functions.

AT5G58230	892.9879882277	1552.3562814155	1.73838428050576	Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

AT5G59820	17.5188599523	1599.1896711482	91.2838892201	Encodes a zinc finger protein involved in high light and cold acclimation. Overexpression of this putative transcription factor increases the expression level of 9 cold-responsive genes and represses the expression level of 15 cold-responsive genes, including CBF genes. Also, lines overexpressing this gene exhibits a small but reproducible increase in freeze tolerance. Because of the repression of the CBF genes by the overexpression of this gene, the authors speculate that this gene may be involved in negative regulatory circuit of the CBF pathway. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Knockouts of CAP1 produced more cytoplasmic NH4+ and ceased growth of root hairs on MS medium except when NH4+ was depleted; NH4+ depletion reestablished the Ca2+ gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.

Represses expression of Constans (CO), a circadian regulator of flowering time.  Interacts with LKP2 and FKF1. Expression oscillates under constant light conditions. Mainly expressed in the vasculature of cotyledons, leaves and hypocotyls, but also in stomata. Localized to the nucleus and acts as a repressor of CONSTANS through binding to the Dof binding sites in the CO promoter. Protein gets degraded by FKF1 in the afternoon. CDF1 binds to the TOPLESS co-repressor protein through an N-terminal motif which is conserved across CDF-like proteins throughout land-plants. This interaction is important for the repression of CO and FT genes during the morning. Loss of CDF1 dependent repression through omission of TPL coordinating residues or through the loss of TPL function in phloem companion cells results in early flowering due to an up regulation of FT.
AT5G62440	468.3772897793	796.8637959466	1.70132885034217	Encodes a protein DOMINO1 that belongs to a plant-specific gene family sharing a common motif present in the tomato DEFECTIVE CHLOROPLASTS AND LEAVES (LeDCL) protein.  DOMINO1 is located in the nucleus.  Arabidopsis embryos carrying the domino1 mutation grow slowly in comparison with wild type embryos and reach only the globular stage at desiccation. The primary defect of the mutation at the cellular level is the large size of the nucleolus that can be observed soon after fertilization in the nuclei of both the embryo and the endosperm.  DOMINO1 might have a role in ribosome biogenesis and in determining the rate of cell division.

In Wassilewskija (Ws) accession: mutant alleles of RPT5a displayed 50% pollen lethality, indicating that RPT5a is essential for male gametophyte development. In the Columbia (Col) accession, a rpt5a mutant allele did not display such a phenotype because the RPT5b Col allele complements the rpt5a defect in the male gametophyte, whereas the RPT5b Ws allele does not. Double rpt5a rpt5b mutants in Col background showed a complete male and female gametophyte lethal phenotype. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Mutations in IBR3 render   plants resistant to indole-3-butryic acid, a putative storage form of the biologically active auxin IAA  (indole-3-acetic acid). IBR3 is hypothesized to carry out the second step in a  &#946;-oxidation-like process of IBA metabolism in Arabidopsis.  Though its subcellular location has not been determined, IBR3 has a peroxisomal targeting  sequence and  two other putative IBA metabolic enzymes (IBR1 and IBR10)  can be found in this organelle. No specific enzymatic activity has been  documented for IBR3, but double mutant analyses with CHY1 argue against a role for IBR3 in general fatty  acid &#946;-oxidation.

AT3G10800	587.4938303545	5561.1057650375	9.46581134593681	Encodes bZIP28, a putative membrane-tethered transcriptional factor. Up-regulated in response to heat; a bZIP28 null mutant has a heat-sensitive phenotype.  bZIP28 has a similar domain structure to the mammalian ATF6 protein involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), and shares a bZIP domain, transmembrane domain, and a canonical S1P cleavage site. The bZIP28 seems to be glycosylated in vivo. bZIP28 does not appear to be transcriptionally up-regulated by UPR-inducing tunicamycin (TM) treatment. But, the expression level of three UPR-related genes is reduced in TM-treated zip28 mutants relative to wild type seedlings. And several UPR genes are transcriptionally upregulated when an N-terminal portion of the bZIP28 protein is expressed using the 35S promoter. A myc:bZIP28 fusion protein appears to be cleaved, likely at a canonical S2 cleavage site, following a TM treatment or a DTT stress-inducing treatment, but not a salt treatment. A portion of the  mGFP:bZIP28 protein present in root cells appears to translocate from the cytoplasm and ER to the nucleus following TM treatment. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Consists of a single exon and is characterized by a conserved C-terminal motif and N-terminal signal peptide.  RALF23 is significantly downregulated by brassinolide treatment of seedlings.   Overexpression of AtRALF23 impairs brassinolide-induced hypocotyls elongation, and mature overexpressing plants are shorter and bushier. RALF23 overexpression produces slower growing seedlings with roots that have reduced capacity to acidify the rhizosphere.
AT3G16640	23004.9504642186	100308.03353914	4.36028035335946	Encodes a protein homologous to  translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) from Drosophila. In flies, TCTP functions guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the TOR signaling pathway. TCTP is expressed throughout the plant with highest levels seen in meristematic regions of the shoot and root. Loss of function alleles are not transmitted through the male gametophyte due to defects in pollen tube growth. Hypomorphs, generated through RNAi, are dwarf and have smaller cells. These plants also have defects in lateral and primary root growth as well as root hair growth. The phenotypes are similar to TOR mutants suggesting that TCTP functions in the is pathway in Arabidopsis as well.

AT3G16770	1636.4389870031	5216.7081358338	3.18784151273946	Encodes a member of the ERF (ethylene response factor) subfamily B-2 of the plant specific ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (RAP2.3).  The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are 5 members in this subfamily including RAP2.2 AND RAP2.12.It is localized to the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional activator through the GCC-box. It has been identified as a suppressor of Bax-induced cell death by functional screening in yeast and can also suppress Bax-induced cell death in tobacco plants. Overexpression of this gene in tobacco BY-2 cells confers resistance to H2O2 and heat stresses. Overexpression in Arabidopsis causes upregulation of PDF1.2 and GST6.   It is part of the ethylene signaling pathway and is predicted to act downstream of EIN2 and CTR1, but not under EIN3. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

AT3G23780	594.4729805113	1246.519174055	2.09684748494857	This gene encodes the second largest, catalytic subunit of the nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (aka RNA polymerase D). The NRPD2 protein is found at nuclear foci that overlap or are adjacent to chromocentromeres but are not fully coincident with chromocentromeres. The loss of NRPD2 leads to the loss of cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S genes and AtSN1 retroelements but has no discernible effect on centromere repeat methylation. This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.

AT3G47450	1775.2714763791	2536.2107612765	1.42863263169723	Encodes a protein with similarity to the bacterial YqeH GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. Mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling and attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence, cell death, nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.  Its localization to the chloroplast is enhanced by S-acylation.

Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.

CPK3 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  CPK6 is also a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK family.

AT4G29830	308.6940287807	433.7814167652	1.40521479627766	VIP3 protein is composed of repeats of WD motif which is involved in protein complex formation. The gene is involved in flower timing and flower development. This gene is predicted to encode a protein with a DWD motif. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays, and DDB1b in co-IP assays, and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  Loss of gene function leads to a redistribution of H3K4me3 and K3K36me2 modifications within genes but not a change in the overall abundance of these modifications within chromatin. Also known as SKI8, a component of the SKI complex involved in exosome mediated RNA degredation.
