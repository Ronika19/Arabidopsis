AT1G04400	5202.0070231689	2215.0095406382	0.425799029254075	Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function.  It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter. It is a novel virulence target of the P. syringae type III secreted effector HopZ2.

AT1G23080	5275.0039443684	1587.9849064186	0.301039567584387	Encodes a novel component of auxin efflux that is located  apically in the basal cell and is involved during embryogenesis in setting up the apical-basal axis in the embryo.  It is also involved in pattern specification during root development.  In roots, it is expressed at lateral and basal membranes of provascular cells in the meristem and elongation zone, whereas in the columella cells it coincides with the PIN3 domain. Plasma membrane-localized PIN proteins mediate a saturable efflux of auxin. PINs mediate auxin efflux from mammalian and yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors. The action of PINs in auxin efflux is distinct from PGPs, rate-limiting, specific  to auxins and sensitive to auxin transport inhibitors. PINs are directly involved of in catalyzing  cellular auxin efflux.
AT1G23260	863.1413329314	575.0746155864	0.66625776526462	MMZ1/UEV1A encodes a protein that may play a role in DNA damage responses and error-free post-replicative DNA repair by participating in lysine-63-based polyubiquitination reactions. UEV1A can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. However, a combination of MMZ1/UEV1A and UBC13A do not do a good job of rescuing an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast. MMZ1/UEV1A transcripts are found at low levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible. The uev1a-1 mutant shows normal sensitivity to MMS in germination assays suggesting that UEV1A is not required for DNA damage tolerance during this developmental stage.

All three together with CsPK3 belong to PsPK3-type kinases. At the N-terminus, all four possess a serine/threonine-rich domain. They are closely related to Arabidopsis kinases PINOID. wag1/wag2 double mutants exhibit a pronounced wavy root phenotype when grown vertically on agar plates (while wild-type plants develop wavy roots only on plates inclined to angles less than 90 degrees), indicating an overlapping role for WAG1 and WAG2 as suppressors of root waving. Simultaneous disruption of PID(AT2G34650) and its 3 closest homologs (PID2/AT2G26700, WAG1/AT1G53700, and WAG2/AT3G14370) abolishes the formation of cotyledons.

AT1G70560	182.2946911829	101.639361852	0.557555248550947	TAA1 is involved in the shade-induced production of indole-3-pyruvate (IPA), a precursor to IAA, a biologically active auxin. It is also involved in regulating many aspects of plant growth and development from embryogenesis to flower formation and plays a role in ethylene-mediated signaling. This enzyme can catalyze the formation of IPA from L-tryptophan. Though L-Trp is expected to be the preferred substrate in vivo, TAA1 also acts as an aminotransferase using L-Phe, L-Tyr, L-Leu, L-Ala, L-Met, and L-Gln. Lines carrying mutations in this gene are unaffected by auxin transporter inhibitor NPA. Double mutant analysis and exogenous auxin treatment suggest that this gene is required for auxin signaling during lateral root and root meristem development.

AT5G03150	223.5356113469	48.4283745539	0.216647245877728	JKD is a nuclear-localized putative transcription factor of the BIRDS/IDD C2H2 zinc finger family. JKD and its homologue BIB, restrict SHR movement to a single layer, the endodermis, and delimit tissue boundaries in the root meristem through a process that involves nuclear retention through protein complex formation. JKD mutation leads to periclinal divisions in the cortex, increased cell numbers in the circumference of the cortical and epidermal layers, a disrupted QC marker expression pattern, and disorganized QC and columella cells. This effect is enhanced in jkd bib double mutants where tissue boundaries cannot be maintained due to excessive SHR movement. JKD and BIB restrict CYCIND6 expression to cortex and endodermis stem cells to prevent formative divisions in the ground tissue.  JKD physically interacts with cell fate determinants SCR and SHR in a cell type specific manner. Native FRET-FLIM analysis showed higher JKD-SCR complex in the endodermis and predominant JKD-SHR in the QC and cortex/endodermis stem cells. In addition, JKD, SCR and SHR form a ternary complex whose conformation is cell type dependent, conformational changes of this complex differentially regulate SCR and WOX5 expression to specify endodermal cell fate and QC function respectively. Its mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Expressed in cotyledons and leaves. Mutants display de-etiolation and derepression of light-induced genes in the dark, dwarfism, male sterility and activation of stress-regulated genes in the light. The expression of the gene using a CPD promoter:LUC fusion construct was shown to be under circadian and light control. Additionally, the circadian regulation was shown to be independent of BR levels as it remains unchanged in <i>bri1</i> mutant lines. CPD appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through a BRI1-mediated signaling pathway that affects FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses.

It appears to be important for the accumulation of fumarate from malate in leaves in the light, and helps to promote nitrogen assimilation under high nitrogen conditions. It does not appear to be necessary for lipid metabolism and seedling growth. Inhibition of fumarate accumulation results in an overall shift in the cold response of leaves, with a complete inhibition of cold acclimation of photosynthesis.

Acts downstream of CTR1 and ethylene biosynthesis, in the same pathway as EIN2 and AUX1, and independent from EIN3 and EIN5/AIN1 pathway. In the root, the protein localizes apically in epidermal and lateral root cap cells and predominantly basally in cortical cells. Functions may be regulated by phosphorylation status. EIR1 expression is induced by brassinolide treatment in the brassinosteroid-insensitive br1 mutant. Gravistimulation results in asymmetric PIN2 distribution, with more protein degraded at the upper side of the gravistimulated root. Membrane sterol composition is essential for the acquisition of  PIN2 polarity. Its expression is downregulated at hypoxic conditions. RAP2.12 overexpression inhibits this downregulation.

In flies, TCTP functions guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the TOR signaling pathway. TCTP is expressed throughout the plant with highest levels seen in meristematic regions of the shoot and root. Loss of function alleles are not transmitted through the male gametophyte due to defects in pollen tube growth. Hypomorphs, generated through RNAi, are dwarf and have smaller cells. These plants also have defects in lateral and primary root growth as well as root hair growth. The phenotypes are similar to TOR mutants suggesting that TCTP functions in the is pathway in Arabidopsis as well.

AT2G17290	524.1059300587	152.4614902794	0.290898235519534	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

ATMLO8 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO5, AtMLO7, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledons and hypocotyl, and in fruit abscission zone, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).

It is a key negative regulator of phytochrome-mediated seed germination and acts by inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthesis, light-mediated suppression of hypocotyl elongation and far-red light-mediated suppression of seed germination, and promoting negative gravitropism in hypocotyls.  Light reduces this activity in a phy-dependent manner.  The protein preferentially interacts with the Pfr forms of Phytochrome A (PhyA) and Phytochrome B (PhyB), is physically associated with APRR1/TOC1 and is degraded in red (R) and far-red (FR) light through the ubiquitin (ub)-26S proteasome pathway to optimize photomorphogenic development in Arabidopsis.  It also negatively regulates GA3 oxidase expression.

AT2G23130	724.7318964425	185.3147532018	0.255701113903578	AGP17 is a lysine-rich arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) and part of a multi-gene family of glycoproteins with approx. 50 members. It falls into one subclass with AGP18 and AGP19, other lysine-rich AGPs. 84% of its proline residues are hydroxylated to hydroproline and its heavy glycosylation accounts for appr. 69% of the molecular weight. The main glycosyl residues are arabinose (30.1%) and galactose (55.1%). Glycosyl linkages are consistent with type II arabinogalactans. AGP17 is predicted to have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)anchor and is localized to the plasma membrane and Hechtian strands. It is expressed in young/old leaves, shoots, suspension cultures and flowers.

AT4G25470	140.0936020368	15.019421038	0.107209899807235	Encodes a member of the DREB subfamily A-1 of ERF/AP2 transcription factor family (CBF2). The protein contains one AP2 domain. There are six members in this subfamily, including CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3. This gene is involved in response to low temperature, abscisic acid, and circadian rhythm. Overexpressing this gene leads to increased freeze tolerance and induces the expression level of 85 cold-induced genes and reduces the expression level of 8 cold-repressed genes, which constitute the CBF2 regulon. Mutations in CBF2 increases the expression level of CBF1 and CBF3, suggesting that this gene may be involved in a negative regulatory or feedback circuit of the CBF pathway.

SNAREs have been divided into four subgroups: Qa-, Qb-, Qc- and R-SNAREs. R-SNAREs are classified into three groups, the Sec22-, YKT6- and VAMP7-like R-SNAREs. One R-SNARE and three Q-SNAREs (one of each subgroup) form the trans-SNARE complex, which governs specific membrane fusions.  VAMP7 proteins consist of three distinct domain, the N-terminal longin-domain (LD), the SNARE motif (SNM) and a transmembrane domain. In spite of the high similarities among the VAMP7 proteins, they show different subcellular localizations. VAMP7C is vacuolar-localized and its LD is essential for the correct localization. Generally, it is suggested that the complete LD is the determinant of subcellular sorting in both animal and plant R-SNAREs.

AT4G39400	3531.0527200704	2094.1160750457	0.59305715350632	Encodes a plasma membrane localized leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction. BRI1 ligand is brassinolide which binds at the extracellular domain. Binding results in phosphorylation of the kinase domain which activates the BRI1 protein leading to BR responses. Residue T-1049 and either S-1044 or T-1045 were essential for kinase function in vitro and normal BRI1 signaling in planta. The structure of BRI1 ligand-binding domain has been determined at 2.5A resolution.  Although BAK1 and BRI1 alone localize in the plasma membrane, when BAK1 and BRI1 are coexpressed, the heterodimer BAK1/BRI1 they form is localized in the endosome. BRI1 appears to be involved in the autonomous pathway that regulates the transition to flowering, primarily through its effects on FLC expression levels, as uncovered by double mutant analyses. This most likely occurs as a result of BRI1-dependent effects on histone acetylation, but not histone triMeH3K4 methylation, at the FLC locus. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
