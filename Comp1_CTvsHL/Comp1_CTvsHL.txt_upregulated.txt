AT5G11260	133.6729003817	1107.364757574	8.28413802956279	Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. Nuclear localization. Involved in light-regulated transcriptional activation of G-box-containing promoters. Negatively regulated by Cop1. Although cytokinins do not appear to affect the gene's promoter activity, they appear to stabilize the protein. HY5 plays a role in anthocyanin accumulation in far-red light and blue light, but not in red light or in the dark. Mutant studies showed that the gene product is involved in the positive regulation of the PHYA-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. Binds to G- and Z-boxes, and other ACEs, but not to E-box. Loss of function mutation shows ABA resistant seedling phenotypes suggesting involvement for HY5 in mediating ABA responses. Binds to the promoter of ABI5 and regulates its expression.

AT5G11310	116.3829348045	274.9299036995	2.36228708411012	The SOAR1 gene encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein which localizes to both the cytosol and nucleus. Down-regulation of SOAR1 strongly enhances, but up-regulation of SOAR1 almost completely impairs, ABA responses, revealing that SOAR1 is a critical, negative, regulator of ABA signalling. Further genetic evidence supports that SOAR1 functions downstream of ABAR and probably upstream of an ABA-responsive transcription factor ABI5. Changes in the SOAR1 expression alter expression of a subset of ABA-responsive genes including ABI5. These findings provide important information to elucidate further the functional mechanism of PPR proteins and the complicated ABA signalling network.

AT5G61350	86.297457119	295.9775219689	3.4297363079976	Encodes a tonoplast-localized receptor-like kinase that regulates root hair tip growth by maintaining cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.CAP1, a tonoplast-localized receptor-like kinase, regulates root hair tip growth by maintaining cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients. Knockouts of CAP1 produced more cytoplasmic NH4+ and ceased growth of root hairs on MS medium except when NH4+ was depleted; NH4+ depletion reestablished the Ca2+ gradient necessary for normal growth. The lower net NH4+ influx across the vacuolar membrane and relatively alkaline cytosolic pH of root hairs in cap1-1 relative to wild type implied that mutation of CAP1 results in more NH4+ accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, CAP1 functionally complemented npr1 kinase yeast mutant defective in high-affinity NH4+ uptake via MEP2, distinguishing CAP1 as a cytosolic modulator of NH4+ level that participates in NH4+ homeostasis-regulated root hair growth by modulating tip-focused cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradients.

AT3G44310	18926.7894624227	43606.5914384072	2.30396135197593	Mutants are resistant to indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN). NIT1 catalyzes the terminal activation step in indole-acetic acid biosynthesis. Predominantly expressed isoform of nitrilase isoenzyme family.   Aggregation of NIT1 in cells directly abutting wound sites is one of the earliest events associated with wound and herbicide-induced cell death.  The protein undergoes thiolation following treatment with the  oxidant tert-butylhydroperoxide. It is also involved in the conversion of IAN to IAM (indole-3-acetamide) and other non-auxin-related metabolic processes. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.
AT3G44320	60.7651687455	452.3128109185	7.44361976205318	This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of indole-3-acetonitrile (IAN) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (EC 3.5.5.1) and IAN to indole-3-acetamide (IAM) at lower levels.  It is the only one of the four Arabidopsis nitrilases whose mRNA levels are strongly induced when plants experience sulphur deprivation. This enzyme likely participates in other non-auxin-related metabolic pathways.

Mutant analyses show that this protein regulates growth and hormonal signaling and attenuates oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also seems to be involved in regulating leaf senescence, cell death, nitric oxide biosynthesis in response to ABA but not exogenous H2O2. This protein also appears to be required for proper plastid biogenesis. Levels of several plastid-localized proteins, including RBCL, ClpP1, and the MEP biosynthesis enzymes DXS and DXR are altered in rif1-1 mutants. This protein was originally characterized as a mitrochondrial-localized nitric oxide synthase, but, the synthase activity was later disproven. In addition, new studies with GFP fusion proteins and chloroplast import assays suggest that this protein is found in chloroplasts.  Its localization to the chloroplast is enhanced by S-acylation.

AT2G34650	161.2034314844	319.1690602017	1.97991480245001	Encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that may act as a positive regulator of cellular auxin efflux, as a a binary switch for PIN polarity, and as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

AT2G47460	8.4548436328	926.7515533842	109.611909295274	"MYB12 belongs to subgroup 7 of the R2R3-MYB family. It strongly activates the promoters of chalcone synthase (CHS), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonol synthase (FLS) and - to a lesser extent - chalcone flavanone isomerase (CHI), but cannot activate the promoters of flavonoid-3'hydroxylase (F3'H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DF). The activation requires a functional MYB recognition element (MRE). Results from the myb12-1f allele indicate that an activation domain might be present in the C-terminus. Overexpression or knock-out plants do not show any obvious phenotype under greenhouse conditions. Young myb12-ko seedlings contain reduced amounts of flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol), while seedlings as well as leaves of MYB12-OX plants displayed an increased flavonoid content. They did not show any significant difference in anthocyanin content. Expression of CHS and FLS shows a clear correlation to MYB12 expression levels. CHI and F3H show increased transcript levels in the MYB12-OX lines, but no differences in the knock-out. Even in the absence of functional MYB12, flavonol biosynthesis is not completely absent, suggesting functional redundancy. " The redundant factors are MYB11 and MYB111 although MYB12 is primarily required for flavonol biosynthesis in roots. Mutations in MYB12 block both auxin and ethylene stimulation of flavonoid synthesis.
